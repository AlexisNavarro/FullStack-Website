# FullStack-Website
This is my first full-stack website where I had the opportunity to work on both the backend and frontend development. For the backend, I utilized JavaScript and the Node.js framework, with a particular focus on Express to leverage its powerful middleware support. To handle user accounts and enable website functionality, I integrated MongoDB as my database. On the frontend, I used React to design and style the website.

To access both the backend and frontend components, you'll find two separate folders inside the 'FullStack website folder' which are named 'server' (backend) and 'client' (frontend). Each folder contains its own readme, providing detailed information about their respective programs.

To be able to see the various commits that were done, there are individual repositories for the client and server in my profile repository list.
